## FAQ: What does the fork do??

The fork rolls back all actions performed since the fork was stabbed, then replays those actions which affected the stabbed block. Let's go through an example level.

1.  Fork the block.

1.  Push a few blocks as illustrated. This blocks the door, but don't worry, this is going to get reverted.

1.  Pick up the fork. All the blocks rewind to the position they had in step 1...

1.  ...and then the forked block repeats its movements.

1.  The blocks are now in a much better arrangement, allowing you to leave the room!

### Art Credits

I am using PlanetCute, a [free tileset](http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html) generously offered by Daniel Cook for the express purpose of *not* making yet another Sokoban clone. Which this game kind of is, before you start using the fork. Sorry, Danc! Anyway, [his blog](http://www.lostgarden.com/) is a great source of insight for independent games developers.

This little octopus fellow also makes an appearance. It's actually a piece of jewelry created by <a href="http://doctor-gus.deviantart.com/">Doctor-Gus</a>, an artist who makes jewelry out of forks! So awesome!
